Description: The National Longitudinal Surveys provide a wealth of sociological data. However, the export facilities provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics result in a crude output format that requires a considerable time commitment from the analyst. The NLSdata package is a companion utility to the NLS Investigator <https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login.jsp> that facilitates reading, interpreting and reshaping NLS data for a wide variety of sociological and longitudinal analyses.
